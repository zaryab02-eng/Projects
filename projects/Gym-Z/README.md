## Project Overview

Gym-Z gives a gym owner a private, isolated workspace where they can:

- Sign in with Google and land in the right place automatically: first-time owners are guided to create a gym workspace, while returning owners go straight to their dashboard
- Create custom membership plans (7/15/30/45/90/180/365 days, or anything else) with their own fees
- Add members with duplicate detection by phone number (prevents double entries, surfaces history + a one-tap **Renew Membership** action instead)
- See a dashboard prioritizing who needs attention first: expired, expiring today, tomorrow, within 3 days, within 7 days
- Track a **Membership Streak** — a count of continuous, on-time renewals (not attendance). Starts at 0 on join and only appears after the first renewal; resets if a membership stays expired past a configurable grace period (default 30 days)
- Dashboard stat cards (Total, Active, Expiring Soon, Expired, Blacklisted) are tappable — each navigates straight to a pre-filtered Members or Blacklist view
- Maintain a permanent, append-only member profile: personal info, current membership, full renewal history, lifetime amount paid, blacklist history
- Blacklist/un-blacklist members while retaining their full history
- Instantly search members by name or phone, fast even with thousands of records
- Appear on a public, no-login **Gym Rankings** leaderboard ranked by active member count

The app installs as a standalone PWA on Android and works offline for previously loaded data via a service worker.

### What each important file does

- **`src/firebase/config.js`** — the only place `initializeApp` is called. All other modules import `auth` and `db` from here.
- **`src/firebase/auth.js`** — every auth operation (Google sign-in, logout) as a plain async function, so pages never talk to the Firebase SDK directly.
- **`src/firebase/firestore.js`** — every Firestore read/write. This is the single source of truth for the database shape; if you're adding a new field or collection, start here.
- **`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`** — exposes `{ user, gym, gymId, loading }` app-wide via `useAuth()`. `gymId` (the Firebase Auth uid) is what every page uses to scope its Firestore queries to that gym's private subtree.
- **`src/router/ProtectedRoute.jsx`** — the gatekeeper for authenticated routes. It redirects signed-in users to the right workspace screen and sends first-time users to `/create-gym` until a gym exists.
- **`src/utils/membershipUtils.js`** — turns an expiry date into an urgency bucket (expired / today / tomorrow / 3 days / 7 days) and into the validity bar's color + percentage. This is the file to edit if you want to change the color thresholds.
- **`src/utils/streakUtils.js`** — computes the next streak count on renewal and resets it if the grace period was exceeded. This is NOT attendance-based, by design.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+ and npm.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> gym-z
cd gym-z
npm install
```

Then copy the environment template and fill in your Firebase project's keys (see [Firebase Project Setup](#firebase-project-setup-from-scratch) below):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will start on `http://localhost:5173`. Hot module reload is enabled — edits to any file in `src/` reflect instantly.

### Local testing

1. Configure Firebase with Google sign-in enabled (see [Firebase Project Setup](#firebase-project-setup-from-scratch)).
2. Open `http://localhost:5173/login` and click **Continue with Google**.
3. After sign-in, the app automatically routes you to `/dashboard` if your gym already exists, or `/create-gym` if you are setting up your first gym.
4. Once a gym exists, the dashboard, members, plans, and blacklist screens load from the authenticated gym workspace.
5. Inside the main app, the navbar shows the current gym name (in cursive) plus a **⋮ menu** with **Delete Gym** and **Logout** actions for the active workspace. Logging out returns you to the public landing page (`/`), not the login screen.

> Google sign-in opens as a popup window (falls back to a full-page redirect only if the popup is blocked or unsupported, e.g. in some installed PWA contexts). Your domain must be listed under Firebase → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains (`localhost` is included by default).

### Google sign-in troubleshooting

If sign-in fails, check the following in Firebase Console:

1. **Authentication → Sign-in method → Google** must be enabled with a support email set.
2. **Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains** should include `localhost` and your deployed host (for example `your-app.vercel.app`).
3. The `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values in `.env` (or your host's environment variables) must match the Firebase web app you registered.
4. For Vercel deployments, confirm the deployed site uses the same Firebase project as the configured API key.
5. Publish the Firestore rules from this repo if you see `Missing or insufficient permissions` after sign-in:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Why popup instead of redirect:** `src/firebase/auth.js` uses `signInWithPopup` as the primary sign-in method, falling back to `signInWithRedirect` only when a popup can't open (blocked, or `auth/operation-not-supported-in-this-environment`, which happens in some installed/standalone PWA contexts). This is intentional — `signInWithRedirect` depends on Firebase's `authDomain` (`*.firebaseapp.com`) successfully persisting auth state across the redirect round-trip. Modern Chrome treats that domain as **third-party storage** relative to your app's own domain (e.g. a Vercel URL) and silently partitions/blocks it — the redirect to Google completes, but the auth result never makes it back, with no visible error. Popups avoid this entirely by relaying the result over `postMessage` between windows instead of via storage. The `same-origin-allow-popups` value in `vercel.json`'s `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` header is required for the popup flow to work.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs an optimized, minified build to `dist/`, including the generated service worker and web manifest (via `vite-plugin-pwa`).

Preview the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deploying the Application

### Option A — Firebase Hosting (recommended, pairs naturally with the rest of the stack)

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
# When asked for the public directory, enter: dist
# Configure as a single-page app: Yes
# Set up automatic builds with GitHub: optional

npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Option B — Any static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.)

1. Build command: `npm run build`
2. Output directory: `dist`
3. Add the same environment variables from `.env` to the host's environment variable settings (all `VITE_FIREBASE_*` keys).
4. Configure SPA fallback routing (all paths → `index.html`) so React Router's client-side routes resolve correctly on refresh.

## Installing the PWA on Android

1. Open the deployed Gym-Z URL in **Chrome for Android**.
2. Log in (or just browse — the manifest is available on any page).
3. Tap the **⋮** menu → **Install app** (or **Add to Home screen**). Chrome may also show an automatic "Install Gym-Z" banner.
4. Confirm the install. Gym-Z now launches full-screen from the home screen icon, in standalone mode with no browser UI, exactly like a native app.
5. Once installed, Firestore reads are cached (via the service worker's `NetworkFirst` strategy) so recently viewed data remains available with a weak or no connection.

## Firebase Project Setup From Scratch

### 1. Create the Firebase project

1. Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) and click **Add project**.
2. Name it (e.g. `gym-z-prod`), accept/decline Google Analytics as you prefer, and click **Create project**.
3. Once created, click the **Web (`</>`)** icon to register a web app. Name it "Gym-Z Web" and skip Firebase Hosting setup for now if you plan to configure it later.
4. Copy the `firebaseConfig` object shown — you'll paste these values into your `.env` file.

### 2. Enable Firebase Authentication

1. In the console sidebar, go to **Build → Authentication → Get started**.
2. Under **Sign-in method**, enable **Google**.
3. Set a project support email when prompted. Firebase auto-provisions the OAuth client for your web app — no extra env vars are needed beyond the standard `VITE_FIREBASE_*` keys.
4. Add your deployed domain (and `localhost` for dev) under **Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains**.

### 3. Creating the Firestore Database

1. Go to **Build → Firestore Database → Create database**.
2. Choose **Start in production mode** (the app ships its own rules — see below).
3. Pick a Cloud Firestore location close to your users (e.g. `asia-south1` for India) — this cannot be changed later.
4. Once created, go to the **Rules** tab and replace the default rules with the contents of `firestore.rules` in this repo, then **Publish**.

### 4. Where to place Firebase configuration keys

Never hardcode Firebase keys into source files. They belong in `.env` at the project root (already git-ignored):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in the values from the `firebaseConfig` object you copied in step 1:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1234567890
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1234567890:web:abcdef1234567890
```

Vite only exposes env vars prefixed with `VITE_` to client code (see `src/firebase/config.js`, which reads them via `import.meta.env`). Restart `npm run dev` after editing `.env` — Vite does not hot-reload environment variable changes.

## Environment Variables (.env)

| Variable                            | Where to find it                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`             | Firebase Console → Project Settings → General → Web app config |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`         | same location                                                  |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`          | same location                                                  |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`      | same location (optional — not required by the app)             |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | same location                                                  |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`              | same location                                                  |

## Firestore Security Rules

The full, ready-to-publish rules live in [`firestore.rules`](./firestore.rules). Summary of the contract they enforce:

- `users/{ownerUid}` — stores the owner's personal list of gyms as a `gymIds` array so a single owner can manage multiple gym workspaces.
- `gyms/{gymId}` — the top-level gym document is readable by everyone for rankings, but only the authenticated owner whose uid matches `ownerUid` can update or delete it. The app also writes the gym's `ownerUid` and a `createdAt` timestamp here.
- `gyms/{gymId}/members/*`, `membershipPlans/*`, `blacklist/*`, and each member's nested `renewals/*` — readable/writable **only** by the authenticated owner whose uid matches the gym's `ownerUid`. This keeps each gym workspace private and prevents cross-gym data access.

To publish updated rules after editing `firestore.rules`:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Database Structure

    └── gymIds: [gymIdA, gymIdB, ...]

    │         fullName, phone, altPhone, address, age, gender,

```

**Why nested subcollections instead of flat top-level collections?** Firestore security rules can express "only the owner of this gym" as a single uid check at the `gyms/{gymId}` level and inherit it down through every subcollection (see `firestore.rules`), which is both simpler to secure and cheaper to query — every query is naturally scoped to one gym's documents without needing a `gymId == X` filter on every read.

**Duplicate detection** queries `members` `where('phone', '==', phone)` scoped to the current gym only (`findMemberByPhone` in `src/firebase/firestore.js`) — Firestore will prompt you to create a single-field index the first time this runs if one doesn't already exist implicitly (single-field equality queries are auto-indexed by default, so no manual index is normally required).

**Gym Rankings** reads the root `gyms` collection ordered by `activeMemberCount desc` — this requires no composite index since it's a single-field sort.

## Reusable Components

All components under `src/components/ui/` are intentionally generic (no Firebase imports, no business logic) so they can be reused or lifted into a design system:

- **`Button`** — variants: `primary` (copper), `secondary` (steel), `ghost`, `danger`, `subtle`; sizes `sm|md|lg`; supports `loading`.
- **`Card`** — the base surface for every panel.
- **`Input` / `Select`** — labeled form fields with built-in error display.
- **`Modal`** — bottom-sheet on mobile, centered dialog on desktop.
- **`Badge`** — small status pill (`warn`, `critical`, `success`, `neutral`).
- **`ValidityBar`** — the signature horizontal membership-validity gradient bar, driven entirely by `utils/membershipUtils.js`.

Feature-specific components (`components/members/*`, `components/plans/*`, etc.) compose these primitives with Firestore calls and are the layer to extend when adding member/plan/blacklist features.

## Guide to Modifying Pages

Every route maps 1:1 to a file in `src/pages/`. To change what a screen shows:

1. Open the matching file (e.g. `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`).
2. Pages read data via hooks (`useAuth()` for the current gym) and the functions exported from `src/firebase/firestore.js` — they don't call Firestore directly.
3. Most pages wrap their content in `<AppShell>` (adds the navbar/sidebar/bottom nav/footer) — public pages like `Landing`, `Login`, `GymRankings` instead compose `<Navbar>` + `<Footer>` directly since they don't need the authenticated app chrome.

## Guide to Modifying Components

- UI-only tweaks (spacing, color, copy) → edit the component directly; Tailwind utility classes are used inline throughout.
- Shared visual language (colors, fonts, radii, shadows) → edit `tailwind.config.js` once, and it propagates everywhere.
- If a change is needed in many places (e.g. every button should get a new hover state) → edit the primitive in `src/components/ui/`, not each call site.

## Guide to Adding New Features

Example: adding a "Trainer Assignment" feature to members.

1. **Data model** — add a `trainerId` / `trainerName` field to the member document shape (document the change in the [Database Structure](#database-structure) section above).
2. **Firestore layer** — add any new query/mutation functions to `src/firebase/firestore.js` (e.g. `assignTrainer(gymId, memberId, trainerId)`).
3. **UI** — add the field to `MemberForm.jsx` and display it in `MemberProfile.jsx`.
4. **Security rules** — if you add a new top-level subcollection (e.g. `gyms/{gymId}/trainers`), it's automatically covered by the existing wildcard rule in `firestore.rules` (`match /{subcollection}/{docId}`) — no rule changes needed unless you want different permissions for it.

## Guide to Changing Business Logic

- **Urgency thresholds / dashboard categories** → `src/utils/membershipUtils.js` (`getUrgencyBucket`).
- **Validity bar color thresholds** → `src/utils/membershipUtils.js` (`getValidityIndicator`).
- **Streak calculation + grace period** → `src/utils/streakUtils.js`. Change `DEFAULT_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS` to adjust the default, or pass a custom value per-gym once you add a settings field for it.
- **Dashboard stat card destinations** → `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` passes an `onClick` to each `StatCard` that navigates to `/members?filter=active|expiring|expired` or `/blacklist`. `src/pages/Members.jsx` reads the `filter` query param via `useSearchParams` and applies it on top of the existing search/sort logic.
- **Duplicate detection key** → currently phone number, enforced in `findMemberByPhone` (`src/firebase/firestore.js`). Changing the unique identifier means updating this query and the Firestore rule assumptions.

## Guide to Customizing the UI

- **Color palette, fonts, shadows** → `tailwind.config.js`. The current palette is an "ink + forged copper" industrial theme (`ink-*` surfaces, `copper-*` primary accent, `steel-*` secondary accent, `vitality-*` for the validity gradient).
- **Light/Dark mode** → `src/context/ThemeContext.jsx` toggles a `.light` class on `<html>`; add `.light` variant overrides in `src/index.css` or via Tailwind's `dark:`/custom selector as needed.
- **Typography** → Google Fonts are loaded in `index.html` (`Oswald` for display/headings, `Manrope` for body text, `IBM Plex Mono` for numeric/data readouts like stats and streak counters). Swap the `<link>` and `fontFamily` values in `tailwind.config.js` to change them.
- **Navbar branding** → `src/components/layout/Navbar.jsx` shows the italic "Gym-Z" wordmark on public pages and the owner's actual gym name (also italic) once inside the app. Gym actions (Delete Gym, Logout) live in a single **⋮** dropdown menu rather than separate buttons.

## Guide to Deploying Updates

```bash
git pull
npm install          # only if dependencies changed
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting   # or push to your static host's connected branch
```

If you changed `firestore.rules`, deploy those too:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

The service worker (via `vite-plugin-pwa`, `registerType: 'autoUpdate'`) automatically fetches and activates new builds for users who already have the PWA installed, typically on their next app open.

## Suggested Future Improvements

- SMS/WhatsApp renewal reminders (e.g. via a Cloud Function triggered on a schedule, cross-referencing `expiryDate`).
- Role-based staff accounts per gym (currently one owner account per gym).
- Exporting member lists / financial summaries to CSV or PDF.
- Multi-branch support for gym chains (a `branches` subcollection under a parent gym).
- Server-side aggregation (Cloud Functions) for `activeMemberCount` instead of client-side `increment()`, to make it fully tamper-resistant.
- Push notifications (via Firebase Cloud Messaging) for expiring memberships, once the PWA has a service worker already in place to extend.
